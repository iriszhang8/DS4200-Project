      "Feature": "Machine Washable Mop Heads   100% Microfiber Mop Heads   Easy Hand Push Self-Wringing",
      "Product Description": "ORIGINAL INVENTOR of the hand pushed spin mop with 6 granted US patents. UNLIKE OTHER SPIN MOPS: NO foot pedal, NO plastic spinning axis, NO other unnecessary moving parts (wheels, agitator) to break or cause leaks. Mop head wrings 2X drier than foot pedal version. Sturdy, yet lightest bucket out of all spin mops makes it easier to fill and dump water. SELF-WRINGING MOP that easily spins dry with a gentle push on the handle. Hands stay dry, no bending, and cuts cleaning time in half. 55\" long handle. Swivel joint pivots 180\u00b0 and rotates 360\u00b0 to clean under furniture and along baseboards. It is also great for cleaning windows, walls, cars, and boats. SUPER ABSORBENT MICROFIBER mop head (14\" in diameter, 2 included) cleans 3X better than cotton, dries floor instantly, and leaves no streaks. Machine washable reusable mop heads last 6-12 months saving hundreds of dollars in refill costs. Can also be used as dry mop to pick up hair and dust. INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.\u200bTwist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn\u2019t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase"

Instructions:   To guarantee that your flowers stay in perfect shape until your wedding day, it is important to follow the care tips below.   We recommend ordering 1-2 days in advance to ensure your flowers hydrate and bloom for your wedding   Upon receiving your flower shipment, open the box and examine it carefully before removing any pieces. Verify the shipment against your purchase order. If any items are missing or damaged, please call our toll-free number immediately (888-620-8895). Do not remove the identification tags from the arrangements until your wedding day.   If you find loose flowers inside the box, don't worry. This may happen during transportation and has been anticipated. Extra flowers are placed in the arrangement during construction to compensate. We recommend you don't discard these extra flowers, and instead use them as petals.   Upon arrival put flowers in water and make sure the glass vials are kept full.   Maintain flowers at a temperature between 35 - 75 F. Avoid extreme temperatures. The colder the storage space, the better to conserve the flowers. DO NOT FREEZE.

This Extreme Burger Lovers Bundle includes:\n(12) 8 oz American Wagyu burgers with12 artisanal brioche burger buns\n75% Lean, 25% Fat\n1 \u00bd lbs (2 - 12 oz packs) heritage applewood smoked bacon\n(1) 8 oz tub of black truffle butter\nJapanese Wagyu & Black Angus Breed\nShips uncooked and frozen UPS 2nd day   Are you ready for the ultimate burger experience? Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D\u2019Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as \u201cAmerican Kobe-style\u201d or simply \u201cWagyu.\u201d The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160\u00b0f.\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter"

      "Product Description": "Bison meat is a nutrient dense food because of the proportion of protein, fat, mineral, and fatty acids to its caloric value. Comparisons to other meat sources have shown that bison meat has a greater concentration of iron, zinc and essential fatty acids.\nBison meat is a rich source of complete protein containing all the essential amino acids in appropriate amounts. Each serving contains about 22 grams of protein which is then used in the body to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and some hormones, and maintain cell membranes and components of the immune system.\nRich in Vitamin B12, Selenium, Zinc and Phosphorus, bison meat is also an excellent source of Iron, Vitamin B6 and Niacin, all of which are recommended daily.\nBison meat contains the \"essential fatty acids\", linoleic (omega - 3) and linoleic (omega - 6) fatty acids. These substances are necessary for us to eat but can not be made in our bodies and are thus, commonly lacking. Their function is to assist the formation of cell membranes, aiding in the production of hormone-like compounds, and participating in immune and visual processes. Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to help fend off Alzheimer's disease and reduce the likelihood of heart attacks."

Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern \u2013 and richly flavored \u2013 chicken. D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water\u2014on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D\u2019Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as \u201cAmerican Kobe-style\u201d or simply \u201cWagyu.\u201d The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160\u00b0f.\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter"

The Japanese beef grading scale is quite different from the USDA scale of Select, Choice and Prime. In Japan, there are 12 different categories of beef quality with the \u201cA5\u201d grade being the best of the very best.Authentic Wagyu's Japanese A5 is imported from Kagoshima, Japan which is located in the far south of Japan. The Kagoshima prefecture is collectively responsible for around 20% of Japan's Kuroge Wagyu cattle, the Wagyu breed that produces Japanese A5 Wagyu. Kagoshima's consistent temperate climate and ecology are well-suited for raising healthy cattle with low stress levels, a necessary component of achieving A5 quality. Kagoshima Wagyu took the top prize at \"The Wagyu Olympics\" this year based on overall contest scores. You could say that Kagoshima's A5 Wagyu is the best beef in Japan right now!"

How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 \u2013 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet\u2014 just enough to coat the salmon \u2014 and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145\u00b0F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"

Thaw these shrimp in the refrigerator overnight, and once thawed, they will keep for up to five days."

This quick and easy one-bowl meal is made with flexible ingredients so that each bowl can be tailored to individual tastes. Raw tuna is the crowning glory of any poke bowl, and only the best quality will do, just as with sashimi.\nBegin your poke bowl with warm rice - brown, white, wild, or short-grain - and add layers of raw vegetables including chopped sweet onion. Make it your own with cucumber, edamame, daikon, or shredded carrot. The cubed tuna should be dressed and briefly marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a little honey. For those that like it hot, add sriracha or red pepper. Slices of creamy avocado make a great addition, along with seaweed salad, or crumbled nori.\nMake poke keto or paleo-friendly by replacing the rice with riced cauliflower, or skipping it altogether and adding more vegetables. Raw and refreshing, this tropical treat is hyper-healthy and allows you to play with color, texture, and flavors each time you create a bowl.\nPoke is an outside-the-box solution for summer gatherings or quick family meals. You will be well prepared for quick and easy meals with this ready-to-eat chopped tuna.\nNot ready to go raw? Quickly pan-sear the cubed tuna and serve over rice, noodles, or stir-fried vegetables. Elevate a tuna wrap with seasoned and lightly seared yellowfin cubes instead of the canned stuff. Any salad will be transformed by seared tuna cubes - even a classic Nicoise salad with green beans, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs.\nTo thaw: Place frozen poke cubes in the refrigerator the night before you plan to prepare your meal. Once thawed, open the package and pair it with your favorite accompaniments.   Pack size: 1lb of cubed Yellowfin Tuna\nTotal packs per order: 6\nShips frozen"

      "Product Description": "Includes:   2x - Boxing containing 8-count, 75ml bottles   From the moment you twist and pop the cap open, and savor this GOLDEN NEST\u00ae swallow nest soup, you will notice a distinct taste, aroma, and texture that can usually be enjoyed ONLY through home-cooking swallow nest soup. This unique characteristic is the fruit of GOLDEN NEST\u00ae, commitment to have all swallow nests be 100% hand-washed and 100% bleaching-free.   The 100% hand-washed method is still the time-tested premier method to minimize the impurities content in the nest. This method, however, is losing its popularity due to significant product loss during the cleaning process. Also, some minor impurities might still remain visible, due to the absence of bleaching agents to \u2018cover\u2019 them (read: \u2018Why Bleaching\u2019 at the back page). However, GOLDEN NEST\u00ae believes that the best swallow nest should always be completely natural; to achieve a 100% natural final product, 100% hand-washed raw swallow is the unwavering, ultimate standard.   Finally, the absence of bleaching agents, along with advanced cooking technology similar to those used in preservatives-free commercial baby food technology, makes this product safe for elderly people, nursing/ pregnant women, and even babies that are ready for solid food. Enjoy!   Made in USA."

Magnatum Pico connects with roots of poplar, willow, hazel, oak and hazel trees and the time of its harvest is very short \u2013 from September till January.   Its skin (peridium) is smooth and ochre yellow or olive yellow in colour, and sometimes it can reveal a more rustic cracked area or light red spots.

      "Product Description": "The chicken breast is the most popular cut for a reason. If you are among its many fans, you\u2019ll rediscover its charms with D\u2019Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle\u2122 Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D\u2019Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern \u2013 and richly flavored \u2013 chicken. D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water\u2014on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 \u2013 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet\u2014 just enough to coat the salmon \u2014 and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145\u00b0F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"

      "Product Description": "Certified Wild Key West Pink Shrimp are caught in the waters around Key West, Florida. These shrimp have an unrivalled flavor that comes from the clean Gulf Stream waters they call home. The history of this fishery is as unique as the flavor. In the 1940\u2019s fisherman discovered large stocks of Pink shrimp in the waters just off Key West. Word soon travelled leading to a shrimping boom where boats came from as far as Texas and the Carolina\u2019s to harvest \u201cPink Gold.\u201d We hope you enjoy the rich flavor of the Gulf\u2019s greatest treasure \u2013 Key West Pink Shrimp!   The shrimp are frozen on board to ensure peak flavor. Minimally processed, shell-on presentation is perfect for \u201cpeel & eat\u201d. No added preservatives or chemicals.

Flash freezing halts the naturaldeterioration of the shrimp and locks in freshness. By purchasing frozen shrimp rather than thawed, you are maintaining the quality and freshness until the moment you are ready to enjoy them. Thaw these shrimp in the refrigerator overnight, and once thawed, they will keep for up to five days."

Seeking a solution to feed his guests dessert, a servant girl in the kitchen offered to make her family\u2019s traditional pastry. The king enjoyed the little cake so much that he named it after the servant: Madeleine. Baked with non-GMO ingredients and free-range eggs. No preservatives, palm oil, hydrogenated oil or colorings. Baked with love in France.We all have our Madeleine moment:Enjoy everyday for breakfast, snack or dessert (Just as the French do!)Pack in lunches or backpacks for schoolServe during business, book club or PTA meetingsCut in half and fill with jelly or chocolate hazelnut spreadDecorate cakes or cupcakes with classic seashell shapeIncludes:100 countIndividually wrappedFree-range eggsNon-GMO ingredients"

It seemed a little odd as a first flavor choice, but once we tasted it we gave him a high five. There is just something special about this buttery mixture of coconuts and cashew along with our signature chewy-crispy texture. This is that secret snack you don't want to tell people about cause they'll buy it all and then there won't be any for you.   Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter\nThis is one of those snacks where you take a bite and then you kinda pull back and look at the snack with a quizzical expression, and then you look at the package, and you think \"there's no way this is healthy\" and kinda shake your head a little when you see that it is indeed healthy and has a lot of protein and is vegan and non-GMO and the people around you kinda see you making weird expressions and moving your head all around but don't really care that much cause they're more interested in their Instagram feed.   Peanut Butter\nWe're simple folk and it doesn't get much simpler than our Peanut Butter Bites. Oh you want a peanut buttery inside with crunchy dry roasted peanut exterior? Check and check. We added some plant protein to let you know this isn't just a huge gob of peanut butter and to make it more \"snack-y\" and satisfying, which we've heard are nice things to have in a snack.   NOTE:All of our products are Certified Gluten Free, Certified non-GMO, Vegan, Certified Kosher, Soy-Free, and made in our very own, dedicated gluten-free facility utilizing sustainable business practices.
