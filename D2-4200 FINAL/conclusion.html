                Costco is known for its bulk groceries, low prices, and loyal members. It offers various 
                products at prices that often beat traditional retailers. This made us curious about how much price influences how customers rate the products they buy and the type/price of the products too.
                <br><br>
                To build on these findings, future analyses could incorporate the number of reviews per product to assess rating reliability. Segmenting ratings and prices by product subcategories also uncover which categories offer the best value and satisfaction.
