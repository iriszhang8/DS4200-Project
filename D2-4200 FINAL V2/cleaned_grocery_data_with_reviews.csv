INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.​Twist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn’t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase"

1 ½ lbs (2 - 12 oz packs) heritage applewood smoked bacon
(1) 8 oz tub of black truffle butter
Japanese Wagyu & Black Angus Breed
Ships uncooked and frozen UPS 2nd day   Are you ready for the ultimate burger experience? Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them
Cook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.
Slowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter
Prepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups
Top off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter"

Never-ever program - no hormones or antibiotics ever
Ships frozen   Ribeyes, Filet mignon's from beef tenderloin, and burgers… oh my! D’Artagnan’s Ultimate Steak Lovers Gift Box is here to satisfy all the carnivores in your life!   American Wagyu Filet Mignon Steaks, 2 Steaks, 6 ounces each. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from a small percentage of Certified Black Angus. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one steak.   American Wagyu Beef Patties, 2 Patties, 8 ounces each. Like the Wagyu beef filets, our burgers come from humanely raised cattle on small family ranches in the west. The Wagyu cattle live on pasture, never receive antibiotics or hormones and are finished in the traditional Japanese way: with incremental amounts of grain that encourage their natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling. 75% Lean, 25% Fat   USDA Choice Bone-In Ribeye Steaks, 2 Steaks, 20 -22 ounces each. These Choice-grade Angus steaks are wet-aged for 21 days to add complexity to the flavor. D’Artagnan’s group of dedicated ranchers raise Angus cattle on open pastureland, without antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances. All you get is clean beefy flavor – as it should be.   As if 3 amazing varieties of fantastic beef weren’t enough, this gift box also comes with gourmet accompaniments to help create the perfect steak dinner!   Black Truffle Butter is a silky creamery butter blended with real black truffles which adds a robust and earthy flavor to elevate steaks to the next level!   Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture. The perfect base for any sauce.   Dried Wild Mushroom Mix is packed with flavor and once reconstituted, makes a great topping on the steaks and burgers.   Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)!   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them
Filet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare
Season steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine
Make a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper if needed."

Total","10 Packs of Bison Ground Meat (1lb Packs Each)   23% to 30% More Protein Compared to Beef   No Gamey or Wild Taste and Federally Inspected   From Free-Range Raised Bison, No Additives or Hormones","Bison meat is a nutrient dense food because of the proportion of protein, fat, mineral, and fatty acids to its caloric value. Comparisons to other meat sources have shown that bison meat has a greater concentration of iron, zinc and essential fatty acids.
Bison meat is a rich source of complete protein containing all the essential amino acids in appropriate amounts. Each serving contains about 22 grams of protein which is then used in the body to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and some hormones, and maintain cell membranes and components of the immune system.
Rich in Vitamin B12, Selenium, Zinc and Phosphorus, bison meat is also an excellent source of Iron, Vitamin B6 and Niacin, all of which are recommended daily.
Bison meat contains the ""essential fatty acids"", linoleic (omega - 3) and linoleic (omega - 6) fatty acids. These substances are necessary for us to eat but can not be made in our bodies and are thus, commonly lacking. Their function is to assist the formation of cell membranes, aiding in the production of hormone-like compounds, and participating in immune and visual processes. Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to help fend off Alzheimer's disease and reduce the likelihood of heart attacks."

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

Japanese Wagyu & Black Angus Breed
Ships uncooked and frozen UPS 2nd day   Are you ready for the ultimate burger experience? Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them
Cook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.
Slowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter

This Japanese A5 Wagyu Sampler Pack includes three cuts of meat, each of which comes from the prized A5 grade of Japanese Wagyu beef. The A5 grade is the highest rating given to Japanese Wagyu, indicating that the meat is exceptionally tender and marbled with fine, evenly distributed fat.
The sampler pack includes one Ribeye Steak, one NY Steak, and one Filet Mignon. The Ribeye Steak is a flavorful and juicy cut that comes from the rib section of the cow. It is well-marbled and has a rich, beefy flavor. The NY Steak, also known as New York Strip or Striploin, is a leaner cut that comes from the short loin section of the cow. It is tender and has a mild, but rich flavor. The Filet Mignon, which comes from the tenderloin section, is the most tender cut of the three. It has a delicate, buttery flavor and a fine, buttery texture.
Each cut in the sampler pack is between 6-12 ounces in size, allowing for a generous tasting of each cut. These cuts are typically prepared using simple seasoning and cooking methods, such as searing on a hot skillet or grill, to allow the natural flavor and tenderness of the meat to shine through.

KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN.Preparation and Cooking Tips:Defrost in the refrigerator overnight prior to cooking. How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 – 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet— just enough to coat the salmon — and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145°F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"

Responsibly caught in the wild by longlines, this premium tuna fish is dolphin-safe and the perfect choice for your poke party.
Poke, which rhymes with okay, is a famous raw fish salad from Hawaii that has been gaining fans around the world. This quick and easy one-bowl meal is made with flexible ingredients so that each bowl can be tailored to individual tastes. Raw tuna is the crowning glory of any poke bowl, and only the best quality will do, just as with sashimi.
Begin your poke bowl with warm rice - brown, white, wild, or short-grain - and add layers of raw vegetables including chopped sweet onion. Make it your own with cucumber, edamame, daikon, or shredded carrot. The cubed tuna should be dressed and briefly marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a little honey. For those that like it hot, add sriracha or red pepper. Slices of creamy avocado make a great addition, along with seaweed salad, or crumbled nori.
Make poke keto or paleo-friendly by replacing the rice with riced cauliflower, or skipping it altogether and adding more vegetables. Raw and refreshing, this tropical treat is hyper-healthy and allows you to play with color, texture, and flavors each time you create a bowl.
Poke is an outside-the-box solution for summer gatherings or quick family meals. You will be well prepared for quick and easy meals with this ready-to-eat chopped tuna.
Not ready to go raw? Quickly pan-sear the cubed tuna and serve over rice, noodles, or stir-fried vegetables. Elevate a tuna wrap with seasoned and lightly seared yellowfin cubes instead of the canned stuff. Any salad will be transformed by seared tuna cubes - even a classic Nicoise salad with green beans, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs.
To thaw: Place frozen poke cubes in the refrigerator the night before you plan to prepare your meal. Once thawed, open the package and pair it with your favorite accompaniments.   Pack size: 1lb of cubed Yellowfin Tuna

NY Strip Steak,"D’Artagnan’s ABF Butcher Box Collection provides ample opportunities to make restaurant-quality steak dinners at home. With three different types of steak included, you’ll expand your repertoire at the grill or in the kitchen.
This impressive gourmet package includes single-portion bavette, hanger, and NY strip steaks. Each steak is individually butchered, trimmed, and vacuum-sealed for your convenience. Keep them in the freezer until the mood strikes or a party gathers.   Bavette steak - also known as sirloin flap - is a cult favorite with butchers and chefs and is often hard to find in grocery stores. This well-marbled steak is similar to flank and skirt cuts, although much beefier and more supple than either. Try marinating bavette steak and then searing or grilling it. Be sure to slice it against the grain to best enjoy the texture and rich flavor.
Hanger steak is nicknamed butcher’s steak because this especially tender and flavorful cut was so often held back to feed the butcher’s family. The cut is from the short plate under the ribs - a muscle that does little work, so it has a lush texture. Whether you are an accomplished chef or a beginner, pan-searing and grilling hanger steak over high heat is easy, and rewards with a flavor similar to ribeye.
NY strip steak is among the most popular cuts of beef and comes from the short loin. With its tender texture, the strip steak is a favorite of steakhouses and countless backyard grillers. Enjoy strip steak with eggs for a hearty breakfast, crusted with pepper and pan-seared, or seasoned simply and grilled to rare or medium rare.   D’Artagnan beef comes from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus breed cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones, or any other artificial substances. They grow slowly and naturally, so the cattle take a little longer to come to market, but that’s fine with us. A stress-free lifestyle produces tasty results. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be.   Features:   Angus-breed cattle

Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture. The perfect base for any sauce.   Dried Wild Mushroom Mix is packed with flavor and once reconstituted, makes a great topping on the steaks and burgers.   Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)!   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them
Filet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare
Season steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine
Make a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper if needed."

This unique characteristic is the fruit of GOLDEN NEST®, commitment to have all swallow nests be 100% hand-washed and 100% bleaching-free.   The 100% hand-washed method is still the time-tested premier method to minimize the impurities content in the nest. This method, however, is losing its popularity due to significant product loss during the cleaning process. Also, some minor impurities might still remain visible, due to the absence of bleaching agents to ‘cover’ them (read: ‘Why Bleaching’ at the back page). However, GOLDEN NEST® believes that the best swallow nest should always be completely natural; to achieve a 100% natural final product, 100% hand-washed raw swallow is the unwavering, ultimate standard.   Finally, the absence of bleaching agents, along with advanced cooking technology similar to those used in preservatives-free commercial baby food technology, makes this product safe for elderly people, nursing/ pregnant women, and even babies that are ready for solid food.

A single cell of honeycomb is filled with the concentrated nectar of thousands of flowers. Honey Comb is the purest, rawest honey available. You cannot get more “raw” and “100 Pure” than honey comb. It’s the ultimate raw honey. Because the honey is still in the comb and has not been touched by humans, it contains pollen, enzymes, propolis, vitamins, amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and aromatics that the bees produced in the hive. The wax that makes up honeycomb contains very-long-chain fatty acids, along with long-chain alcohols, or esters. The honey stored within the honeycomb is the purest, rawest form of honey, and the wax the honeycomb is made of has nutritional value and health benefits. We cut our comb from the frame by hand and pack it for your enjoyment with no additional treatment or processing.   We carefully select and hand cut each square then pack them in a clear, resealable, plastic container. Honeycomb is the purest way to enjoy honey…just as nature intended.   3 Pack, 36 ounces total net weight

The Southern European white truffle, Tuber Magnatum Pico is one of the most renowned in the world, and gourmets and culinary connoisseurs are increasingly attracted by this amazing truffle.It is the most exclusive edible truffle in the world. Magnatum Pico connects with roots of poplar, willow, hazel, oak and hazel trees and the time of its harvest is very short – from September till January.   Its skin (peridium) is smooth and ochre yellow or olive yellow in colour, and sometimes it can reveal a more rustic cracked area or light red spots. The gleba (fleshy inner mass) is firm in structure, at the beginning whitish and then pale yellow, ochre brown, reddish brown, streaked with many thin white lines.   Intensive in scent and strong but pleasant in flavor.   For best storing: wrap each truffle singularly in paper towel, place them inside a glass jar, and store in your fridge. Replace the paper towel daily.   Remember: Truffles do not like humidity!   Truffle is underground tuberous fungus, considered to be the height of gastronomy. It grows in the heart of central and southern Europe, in a humid and grey soil of the European forests.

Total",24 Total Breasts   2 Breasts Per Pack   12 Total packs   Minimum Weight of 11 lbs   Ships Uncooked & Frozen,"The chicken breast is the most popular cut for a reason. If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

If touched briefly it is harmless, but prolonged contact with the skin will cause injury similar to a burn. KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN.Preparation and Cooking Tips:Defrost in the refrigerator overnight prior to cooking. How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 – 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet— just enough to coat the salmon — and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145°F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"
