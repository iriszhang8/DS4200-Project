            <h2>1. Product Count by Category Interactive (Altair)</h2>
            <p>
                This visualization uses colors as a mark to differentiate the categories of each subcategory. Specifically, blue represents food, red represents beverages, green represents household, and orange represents other products. The gray horizontal lines make it easier for the viewer to interpret the values at a glance (though they may also hover over the bars to get the specific values if they choose). Furthermore, the labels on the x-axis are tilted at a 45-degree angle to improve the readability, as they can get fairly long.

            <h2>2. Heatmap by Product Price Range (%)</h2>
            <p>
                This heatmap uses a blue sequential color scheme with Costco’s brand to visualize the distribution of product subcategories across different price ranges. Darker blues show higher concentrations of products within a price range, making patterns easy to identify. It uses a tilted label design on the horizontal axis to display subcategory names since many subcategories have long names. The vertical stacking of price ranges, blue sequential color scheme, and angled labels make it more visually appealing.

            <h2>3. Bar Plot – Price vs Rating (D3)</h2>
            <p>
                This interactive barplot uses a simple white background with clear black text for readability, and again uses shades of blue that align with Costco’s branding. The color scale moves from light to dark blue by increasing price ranges from budget-friendly items to more premium options making it easy to compare. Users can filter the view using the dropdown menus at the top, which let you choose a main product category and then narrow it down to a specific subcategory or see them all together. The hover feature adds a helpful layer of detail and when you move your mouse over a boxplot, you can see exactly how many products are in that price range, along with their rating. On the right side, the product list updates automatically based on your selection, showing item names, prices, and ratings.

            <h2>4. Scatterplot – Price After Discount vs Rating</h2>
            <p>
                This density plot has a simple clean design that makes it easy to compare customer ratings between discounted and full-price items. It uses a white background to keep the focus on the curves with red for discounted products and blue for full-price ones (consistent with Costco’s branding). The filled curves help show how ratings are distributed, and the overlap between them makes it clear where the differences lie. Labels on the axes are easy to read, and when you hover over the lines the tooltips pop up with exact rating and density values.

            <h2>5. Food Marketing Terms by Price Category</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="costco_viz5.twbx" target="_blank">This</a> visualization uses different colors for each marketing term, so viewers can compare the values for each term across the price categories: $<15, 15-30, 30-50, 50-100, 100-200, and >200 (the same as in visualization 2). For example, the orange bars represent the number of “kosher” products, and the viewer can easily see how this value differs for the different price levels of products, by looking at all of the orange bars. The darker gray horizontal lines separate each price category from each other, and the lighter gray vertical lines help the viewer interpret the product counts for each marketing term.

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Our analysis of Costco’s online marketplace reveals key patterns in product availability, pricing, and customer satisfaction. Most products fall under the Food category, with durable goods like Snacks and Pantry items dominating. Perishable subcategories like Deli and Poultry are less represented, likely due to delivery constraints. Price ranges vary widely: Meat & Seafood leads in higher-priced items, while Snacks and Pantry goods are concentrated in lower to mid-price tiers. Product ratings remain high overall, though full-price items receive more consistently strong reviews. Discounted products show more variability but still offer solid value. Interestingly, marketing labels like “organic” and “gluten-free” appear more in lower price tiers, challenging the idea that health-conscious products are primarily premium.
                <br><br>
                It would be interesting to see how our findings compare to in-store purchases, where Costco’s bulk pricing and customer decision-making may influence purchases differently. In the future, we might go further and explore regional pricing differences and conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews to gain deeper insights into Costco’s pricing and product strategies.
